This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ 'The Global School for Remote Software Developers!').

In this project, I worked on my portfolio web-site using react-redux. For the design I have used Charlie Waite's website design. You can see his web-site [here](http://charliewaite.me/)

## Json Data

For the project details I am using a json file and making an async request to get the details. So in the future I can directly add a new project into my json file which will automatically be rendered.

## Built With

- React
- Redux
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js
- npm
- Create-React-App
- SCSS.

### ✨ [Live Demo](https://emreaybey.com)

## Usage

> Clone the repository to your local machine

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/YemreAybey/portfolio-react.git
```

> cd into the directory, install dependencies, build and start

```sh
$ cd basic-bookstore-redux
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

> Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000` using your favourite broswer, if it doesn't open automatically.
